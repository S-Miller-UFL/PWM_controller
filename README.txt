This project contains multiple components (I will push them separately so you can use them by themselves):
1. An N bit up/down counter with preload capability
2. An N bit register
3. A two by one mux.

To compile this project, simply open the QPF in quartus and compile it as you normally would.

I did not write a testbench for this because modelsim was giving me strange errors that had to do with the device i selected. Something about it not being able to find files? I was never able to figure out the cause.
